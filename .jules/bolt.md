## 2024-04-13 - [Path.resolve() Bottleneck]
**Learning:** `Path.resolve()` is significantly slower than building and asserting paths, and `Path.is_relative_to()` is much faster than `Path.relative_to()`. When validating large amounts of files, defer resolving to absolute paths if not necessary.
**Action:** Replace `Path.relative_to(root)` in try/except blocks with `Path.is_relative_to(root)`. Avoid unnecessary `Path.resolve()` calls in hot paths like link target resolution in the wiki linter.
