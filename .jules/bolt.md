## 2025-04-14 - [Pathlib Operations Performance Anti-pattern]
**Learning:** Eager `pathlib.Path.resolve()` calls inside hot loops (like `Path.rglob()`) cause a severe performance bottleneck due to excessive and expensive OS stat calls. Additionally, using `try/except Path.relative_to()` for bounds checking is slower and less pythonic than `Path.is_relative_to()`.
**Action:** Remove eager `.resolve()` calls in hot loops when iterating over paths, resolving only when strictly necessary. Use `.is_relative_to()` for bounds checking instead of `try/except ValueError` with `.relative_to()`.
