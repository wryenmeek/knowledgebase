## 2026-04-15 - [API Key Exposure]
**Vulnerability:** GITHUB_TOKEN and JULES_API_KEY were partially validated and redacted across different fleet scripts, leading to potential sensitive key exposure in error logs and missing validations where they were needed.
**Learning:** Partial token validation and redaction across a multi-script fleet can lead to sensitive key leakage. Every script must validate all necessary keys on startup and ensure redaction utilities cover all sensitive tokens.
**Prevention:** Centralize token validation and redaction logic. Ensure any string interpolation or logging involving potentially tainted input uses a comprehensive redaction utility for all known sensitive keys in the environment.
